# hdojo-arcade-cabinet
Project to build commnunity-driven arcade game machine.

### What:
A bar-top arcade cabinet where the games come from the Hacker Dojo community itself.

### Why:
- Design and build things just for fun again without worrying about revenue models, seed funding, quarterly earnings calls, etc. 
- Not another boring SaaS app / B2B webapp (eughhh).
- Try out languages, frameworks, software packages or techniques you might not ordinarily get to use.
- Fun!

### How:
- Laser-cut wooden outer shell
- 17-inch 1280x1024 LCD display
- Board cannibalized from either an old PC or a 'headless' laptop ^((would rather not go into how it became headless))
- Inexpensive, moderately-fast USB storage device
- Fighting-game controller cannibalized from another project
- Semi-hardened Debian install with most of the boring bits stripped out of it
